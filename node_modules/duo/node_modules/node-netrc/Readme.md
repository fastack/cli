# node-netrc

  Higher-level `~/.netrc` parser

## Example

```js
var netrc = require('node-netrc');
var auth = netrc('api.github.com');
auth.login // ...
auth.password // ...
```

## API

### `netrc([host])`

Return the `login` and `password` details of `host`. Or return `false`.

If no `host`, return all the hosts.

## Testing

    npm install
    make test

> Note: you'll need `raw.github.com` & `api.github.com` set in your `~/.netrc` for the tests to function properly.
